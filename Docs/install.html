<h1>Resource Files Unit</h1>
<h2>Installation Notes</h2>
<!-- Common -->
<p>The resource file unit is <code>PJResFile.pas</code> and it is included in
a zip file.

<p>If you want to simply include the unit in your projects simply extract
<code>PJResFile.pas</code> from the zip file and place it in the
required folder. Either add the unit to your project or ensure the unit on the
compiler search path and simply <em>use</em> it in your project.</p>

<p>The unit can also be installed into a Delphi package in a similar way to
how components are installed. Installing to a package included in the component
library means that the unit can simply be referenced in projects without
adding it to the project. To do this, use the following instructions. (Note that
$(DELPHI) refers to the directory where Delphi is installed.)</p>

<ol>
	<li class="spaced">Unzip the downloaded zip file into a folder of your
	choice, preserving the directory structure.</li>
	<li class="spaced">Copy <code>PJResFile.pas</code> to where you wish to
	install into Delphi. This will probably be a sub-folder of the
	<code>$(DELPHI)\lib</code> folder.</li>
	<li class="spaced">Install the unit into an existing package by choosing
	the <em>Component | Install Component</em> menu option to display the
	<em>Install Component</em> dialog box. Then:
		<ul>
			<li class="spaced">Select the <em>Into existing package</em>
				tab.</li>
			<li>Click the <em>Browse</em> button next to the <em>Unit file
				name</em> edit box to display the <em>Unit file name</em>
				dialog box.</li>
			<li>Select <code>PJResFile.pas</code> from the file dialog and
				click <em>OK</em> to return to the <em>Install Component</em>
				dialog box.</li>
			<li>Choose the package into which you wish to install from the
				<em>Package file name</em> drop down list.</li>
			<li>Click <em>OK</em>.</li>
			<li>A confirmation dialog box may be displayed, querying whether
				it is OK to rebuild and reinstall the package. Click
				<em>Yes</em> to proceed.</li>
			<li>The package will now be rebuilt.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="spaced">If you wish you can now delete <code>PJResFile.pas</code>
		from the place where you copied it (but ensure that the
		<code>.dcu</code> file is not deleted).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note there is no help file for this unit, but the a user guide is included
in the download where each routine, property and method is described and sample
code is presented.</p>
